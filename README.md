## This fork maintains only these emulators, thus they will work
| Emulator/Frontend | Version | Executable name (case sensitive) |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| DuckStation | stable, latest | duckstation-qt-x64-ReleaseLTCG.exe |
| PCSX2 | stable, latest | pcsx2-qt.exe<br>pcsx2-qtx64.exe<br>pcsx2-qtx64-avx2.exe |
| PCSX-REDUX | latest | pcsx-redux.exe |
* NOTE: PCSX2 will only hook with **BIOS versions 5XXXX and up**.

## How to Use
1. Start emulator first
2. Start MouseInjector, read initial information then press ctrl+1
3. Make sure game is running and press '4' to hook into the process
    1. If game is supported then the mouse will be captured at the position it was at when hooked
        * You will be <b><u>unable</u></b> to use the mouse elsewhere while it is hooked, press 4 to unhook
        * Some games depend on post startup values/addresses so hook may not happen immediately
            * DuckStation games usually will not hook until after the startup sequence
    2. Unsupported/broken games will not hook and mouse won't be captured
4. Adjust options with numbers 4-7 while in-game, ctrl+0 will lock the settings
* NOTE: The cursor still moves but gets moved back to it's initial hook position so windowed mode may not
work very well if you have also mapped the mouse buttons as you may click off the window. Fullscreen is
recommended and with dual-monitors it is recommended to put the cursor in the corner before hooking to
avoid clicking off the window.

# How to use with PCSX-REDUX
For debugging and patch creating it is a better to use PCSX-REDUX. It has hands down the best PSX code debugger out there. 
To use this injector with the emulator, you will need to run this lua script in PCSX-REDUX everytime you want to use the
Mouse injector with it. This script creates a simple text file in the emulator's directory with the pointer to 
the game's memory within the emulator process.

```lua
local ffi = require("ffi")
local mem = PCSX.getMemPtr()
local base = tonumber(ffi.cast("uintptr_t", mem))

local file = io.open("emuoffset.txt", "w")
file:write(string.format("0x%X\n", base))
file:close()

print(string.format("ADDRESS DUMPED TO TXT: 0x%08X", base))
```

# **|  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  |**
### Q: How do I install?
  - The program has no installation and will work from any directory. Just download the <br>
  **latest release**, extract the contents of the archive to a convenient location and run<br>
  the executable.
### Q: Why is game not hooking?
  - If the game is not hooking there are a few things to check:
    - Only one supported emulator is running
    - Emulator is supported and version matches what is listed in this README<br>
    (Newer or older versions may work, but the listed version is tested working)
    - ROM/ISO match the version/serial listed in this README
    - **PCSX2**: PS2 BIOS version is **5XXXX or higher**
  - **NOTE**: The program has only been tested on **Windows 11 24H2** and may not be compatible<br>
  with other versions of Windows
  - **NOTE**: If emulator is restarted, the injector must be restarted as well
### Q: Game hooks but is not listed as supported?
  - There are many games that hook but aren't listed as supported as they are unfinished<br>
  hacks. A game is added to the supported list when enough testing has been done to assume<br>
  that the core game can be completed without any major issues.
### Q: Where is the controller input profile?
  - The releases don't include input profiles but I've added my controller profiles to the<br>
  project if you would like to use the same configuration. Although you should probably just<br>
  make your own.
### Q: Will this work with netplay/online?
  - Most likely **NO**, single-player only.
